General Instruction: 
    Compress all files and submit the compressed file. 
    It is expected that there are 5 files in the compressed file (1 pdf, 4 c programs). 
    Compressed file format <lastname>_<firstname>_assignment1.zip


I.  The following questions will need to be saved in a pdf file. 
        The file format of the pdf file is <lastname>_<firstname>_assignment1.pdf:

    1.  Write a statement that asks the user to type three integer and
            another statement that stores the user responses into first, second, third.
 
    2.  List 3 standard data types of C.
 
    3.  The average pH of citrus fruits is 2.2, and this value has been stored
            in the variable avg_citrus_pH Provide a statement to display this information
            in a readable way.
 
    4.  Write an algorithm that allows for the input of an integer value,
            doubles it, subtracts 10, and displays the result.
    
    5.  Given the following declarations:

            #define PI 3.14159
            #define MAX_I 1000
            double x, y;
            int a, b, i;


Indicate which of the following statements are valid, and find the value stored by each
    valid statement. Also indicate which are invalid and why. Assume that a is 3, b is 4,
    and y is -1.0:

    a.  i = a % b;
    b.  i = (989 − MAX_I) / a;
    c.  i = b % a;
    d.  x = PI * y;
    e.  i = a / −b;

    f.  x = a / b;  
    g.  x = a % (a / b);
    h.  i = b / 0;
    i.  i = a %(990 − MAX_I);
    j.  i = (MAX_I − 990) / a;
    k.  x = a / y;
    l.  i = PI * a;
    m.  x = PI / y;
    n.  x=b/a;
    o.  i = (MAX_I − 990) % a;
    p.  i = a % 0;
    q.  I = a % (MAX_I−990);

    

Write pseudocode versions for 6-9.


    6.  An algorithm that gets three data values x, y, and z as input and outputs 
        the average of those three values.
    
    7.  An algorithm that gets the amount of electricity used in kilowatt-hours and 
        the cost of electricity per kilowatt hour. Its output is the total amount of 
        the electric bill, including an 8% sales tax.
    
    8.  An algorithm that is given three numbers corresponding to the number of times 
        a race car driver has finished first, second, and third. The algorithm computes
        and displays how many points that driver has earned given 5 points for a first, 
        3 points for a second, and 1 point for a third place finish.


II.  Each of the following questions will need to be saved as c file. The file format 
    of the c file is <lastname>_<firstname>_assignment1_<question#>.c

    1.  Write a program that asks the user to enter the radius of a circle and then
        computes and displays the circle’s area. Use the formula.

        Area = PI x Radius x Radius
        where PI is the constant macro 3.14159

    2.  Write a program to compute the average of three given numbers.
    3.  Write a program to compute the seconds from a given Age.
    4.  Write a program to swap values of two integer variables.
